### What I do
I am a second year Bachelor in Computer Science student pursuing my Erasmus Semester in at Technische Universit√§t Wien in summer 2023/24. My interests are in simulations, high performance things (especially computers) and Competitive programming. I participated in the Benelux algorithm Contest 2023 and in North-Western European Regional Contest 2023. 
Even though my stats tell you otherwise, I do a lot of Java and Python programming and C# is just a hobby for Unity projects.
